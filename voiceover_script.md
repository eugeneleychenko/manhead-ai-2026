---

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Duration:** 10 seconds
**[TRANSITION CUE: Fade in]**

Steve, this is our AI implementation roadmap for Manhead. Built on ten years of working inside your systems, understanding what works, what doesn't, and where the real opportunities are.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 2]**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY SECTION (Slides 2-8)
**Total Duration:** ~3 minutes (detailed coverage)**

---

### SLIDE 2: The Bottom Line
**Duration:** 25 seconds
**[EMPHASIS: Direct, confident opening]**

Let's start with the bottom line. Manhead is ready for AI. You've already got working AI in production—shipping slip automation is running right now. Your systems infrastructure is solid. And you've got clear opportunities.

The question isn't whether to invest in AI. **[PAUSE]** It's how to do it without wasting money on tools that can't deliver because the foundation isn't there.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 3]**

---

### SLIDE 3: What's Already Working
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**[EMPHASIS: Build credibility]**

Before we talk about what's next, let's acknowledge what's already running. Merch Wizard—your creative workflow platform—is live and actively used by the design team. Mission Control pulls touring data from Atvenu and e-commerce from Shopify, organized by band. It exists, it just needs a relaunch. And shipping slip automation? That's AI-powered data entry working in production today.

You're not starting from zero. You're building on a foundation that most companies don't have.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 4]**

---

### SLIDE 4: Why Foundation Matters
**Duration:** 30 seconds
**[EMPHASIS: Explain the "why" - strategic reasoning]**

Here's the goal: you want to ask "How did Band X perform at the transaction level across their last tour?" and get an answer in thirty seconds. That's entirely achievable.

But here's the reality. That question requires pulling transaction-level data from Atvenu, which currently doesn't have a proper read-write API integration. The data exists—it's just not accessible in a way AI can reliably query.

This is why most AI roadmaps fail. They start with chatbots and dynamic pricing and skip the plumbing. The good news? The plumbing work isn't massive. It's targeted gap-filling, not a rebuild.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 5]**

---

### SLIDE 5: Quick Wins
**Duration:** 35 seconds
**[EMPHASIS: Concrete deliverables, ROI on #4]**

Let's talk about quick wins—things we can deliver in sixty to ninety days.

First: AI mockup generation in Merch Wizard. Automatically superimpose approved designs onto different shirt styles and colors. Saves hours per project.

Second: Mission Control relaunch. Updated dashboards, training for leadership. The tool already exists—we're activating it.

Third: Design team AI training. Get the creative team fluent in Midjourney, DALL-E, AI-assisted ideation. Immediate productivity lift.

Fourth—and this is the big one: **[EMPHASIS]** Royalty email parsing automation. Automate ingestion of sales reports from Zumiez, Spencer's, and other retail partners. This alone saves **forty-plus hours per quarter**.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 6]**

---

### SLIDE 6: ROI Snapshot
**Duration:** 25 seconds
**[EMPHASIS: Hit the 40+ hours hard]**

Let's talk ROI. The royalty email parsing is measurable—**[EMPHASIS]** forty-plus hours per quarter back to your accounting team. Real time savings.

The other quick wins deliver qualitative value: faster mockup turnaround, better leadership visibility, more creative experimentation.

But the foundation work—data infrastructure, Atvenu integration—that's where the bigger ROI lives. It unlocks everything in the full menu: automated settlements, AI forecasting, transaction-level analytics.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 7]**

---

### SLIDE 7: Recommended Starting Point
**Duration:** 20 seconds
**[EMPHASIS: Clear recommendation]**

Here's my recommendation: start with quick wins plus foundation work in parallel. You get momentum and visible progress while building toward bigger capabilities. This isn't sequential—these are parallel tracks.

Build the foundation while delivering immediate wins. That's how you avoid the trap of flashy tools that don't work.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 8]**

---

### SLIDE 8: What Happens Next
**Duration:** 20 seconds
**[EMPHASIS: Call to action]**

If this direction makes sense, here's what happens next. We schedule a discovery call to talk through priorities and scope. Then we move to project-based engagement—each item is a discrete deliverable with clear outcomes. No long-term commitments required.

First projects would likely be the quick wins plus initial data infrastructure work.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 9]**

---

## MAIN CONTENT SECTION (Slides 9-18)
**Total Duration:** ~2 minutes (faster pace, 10-12 seconds per slide)**

---

### SLIDE 9: The Opportunity
**Duration:** 12 seconds

You've already been thinking about this: order management, settlement automation, personalization, dynamic pricing. These are the right categories. The challenge is getting there without building on shaky foundations.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 10]**

---

### SLIDE 10: Core Systems
**Duration:** 10 seconds

Here's your current systems landscape: NetSuite for accounting, Monday for project tracking, ShipHero for fulfillment, Atvenu for touring, Shopify for approximately one-fifty artist stores, and HubSpot for CRM.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 11]**

---

### SLIDE 11: Custom Infrastructure
**Duration:** 10 seconds

And here's the custom infrastructure already in place: Merch Wizard managing creative workflows, Mission Control pulling financial data, integrations between NetSuite and Monday, Atvenu and ShipHero, and that shipping slip automation running in production.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 12]**

---

### SLIDE 12: Legacy Processes
**Duration:** 12 seconds

Then there's the Royalty Calculator—a Google Sheet that's been in use for over a decade. It works, but it's fragile, requires manual intervention, and takes forty-plus hours per quarter to maintain. It wasn't designed for the scale Manhead operates at today.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 13]**

---

### SLIDE 13: The Foundation Problem (Detailed)
**Duration:** 12 seconds

AI is only as good as the data it can access. When you ask "How did this band perform at the transaction level?"—that should be a thirty-second answer. But without proper API integrations, the data exists but isn't accessible.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 14]**

---

### SLIDE 14: What Happens Without It
**Duration:** 10 seconds

Without solid infrastructure, AI tools hallucinate answers because they can't access real data. Integrations break. Teams lose trust in the technology. You spend money on tools that can't deliver.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 15]**

---

### SLIDE 15: The Path Forward
**Duration:** 12 seconds

The path forward: systems need reliable bi-directional integrations. Data needs to be structured and trustworthy. Manual processes need automated ingestion. This isn't about delaying the good stuff—quick wins and foundation work happen in parallel.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 16]**

---

### SLIDE 16: What's Already Built
**Duration:** 10 seconds

Before building new, maximize what exists. Mission Control consolidates data and could be re-launched with enhanced capabilities. Merch Wizard is actively used and ready for AI enhancements. Shipping slip automation proves AI works at Manhead.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 17]**

---

### SLIDE 17: What Happens Next (Detailed)
**Duration:** 12 seconds

Two options: Option A—quick wins plus foundation work in parallel. This gives you visible progress while setting up for bigger capabilities. Option B—start with discovery engagements if we need more visibility into specific departments before prescribing solutions.

**[TRANSITION CUE: Arrow right → Slide 18]**

---

### SLIDE 18: How We Work
**Duration:** 10 seconds

Here's how we work: project-based, discrete deliverables, no long-term commitments. Clear scope and outcomes. Realistic timelines. We tell you what's actually achievable, not what sounds good.

---

## RECORDING TIPS

1. **Read through entire script 2-3 times** before recording to establish natural flow
2. **Record in sections:** Title, Exec Summary, Main Content, Appendix, Closing
3. **Use pauses strategically** - particularly before ROI numbers and key recommendations
4. **Emphasis through pacing** - slow down slightly on key points, not louder
5. **Keep energy consistent** - executive briefing energy throughout, no "performance voice"
6. **Test against timing** - record and check against target times, adjust reading pace
7. **Natural breathing** - don't rush to fit timing, adjust script if needed
