# AI Implementation Proposal for Manhead Merch

**Prepared by Citadines Group**

---

## Executive Summary

### The Bottom Line

Manhead is ready for AI. You've already got working AI in production, solid systems infrastructure, and clear opportunities. The question isn't whether to invest in AI—it's how to do it without wasting money on tools that don't work because the foundation isn't there.

### What's Already Working

Before talking about what's next, here's what's already running:

- **Merch Wizard** — Your creative workflow platform is live and actively used by the design team. It manages briefs, mockups, feedback, and approvals. This is a strong foundation for AI enhancements.
- **Mission Control** — Financial reporting tool that pulls touring data from ATVENU and e-commerce data from Shopify, organized by band. Built for leadership visibility. It exists—it just needs a relaunch.
- **Shipping Slip Automation** — AI-powered data entry into ShipHero. Already running in production. This is proof that practical AI works at Manhead.

You're not starting from zero. You're building on a foundation that most companies don't have.

### The Foundation Problem (Why This Matters)

You want to ask "How did Band X perform at the transaction level across their last tour?" and get an answer in 30 seconds. That's the goal.

Here's the reality: that question requires pulling transaction-level data from ATVENU, which currently doesn't have a proper read/write API integration. The data exists, but it's not accessible in a way that AI—or any reporting tool—can reliably query.

This is why most AI roadmaps fail. They start with the flashy stuff (chatbots, personalization, dynamic pricing) and skip the plumbing. The result? Expensive tools that hallucinate answers, integrations that break, and teams that lose trust in the technology.

The good news: the plumbing work isn't massive. It's targeted gap-filling, not a rebuild.

### Quick Wins (60-90 Days)

These are things we can deliver fast that show visible progress:

- **Merch Wizard AI mockup generation** — Automatically superimpose approved designs onto different shirt styles, colors, and products. Saves hours of design time per project.
- **Mission Control relaunch** — Updated dashboards, leadership training, and onboarding. The tool already exists—we're activating it.
- **Design team AI tools training** — Get the creative team fluent in Midjourney, DALL-E, and AI-assisted ideation. Immediate productivity lift.
- **Royalty email parsing automation** — Automate the ingestion of emailed sales reports from Zumiez, Spencer's, and other retail partners. **Saves 40+ hours per quarter** of manual data entry.

### ROI Snapshot

The royalty email parsing alone saves **40+ hours per quarter**—that's real, measurable time back. The other quick wins deliver value that's harder to quantify but immediately visible: faster mockup turnaround, better leadership visibility, more creative experimentation.

The foundation work (data infrastructure, ATVENU integration) is where the bigger ROI lives. It unlocks everything in the full menu: automated settlements, AI-powered forecasting, transaction-level analytics.

### Recommended Starting Point

Start with quick wins plus foundation work in parallel:

1. **Quick wins** build momentum and show visible progress
2. **Data infrastructure** (especially ATVENU integration and email parsing) unlocks everything else

This isn't sequential—it's parallel tracks. You get wins while building toward the bigger capabilities.

### What Happens Next

If this direction makes sense:

1. **Discovery call** — Let's talk through priorities and scope
2. **Project-based engagement** — Each item is a discrete deliverable with clear outcomes
3. **First projects** — Likely the quick wins above plus initial data infrastructure work

No long-term commitments required. Each project stands on its own.

## The Opportunity

Manhead is ready for AI. The question is: where do you start?

The opportunity is real. AI can transform how Manhead operates—from automating tour settlements to generating merch mockups to giving leadership instant answers about any band's performance.

You've already been thinking about this. Order management, settlement automation, personalization, dynamic pricing—these are the right categories. The challenge is getting there without the common pitfalls: building on shaky data foundations, adopting tools before the infrastructure supports them, or chasing flashy features that don't actually work in practice.

This proposal shows the path from where you are today to where you want to be—and makes sure every step actually works.

## Where Manhead Is Today

Manhead runs on a mix of enterprise systems, custom integrations, and legacy processes that have evolved over years of growth.

### Core Systems

**NetSuite** — Accounting and finance

**Monday.com** — Project and PO tracking for Touring and E-com

**ShipHero** — Warehouse and fulfillment

**ATVENU** — Touring operations (inventory, pricing, show totals)

**Shopify** — E-commerce across approximately 150 artist stores

**HubSpot** — CRM (usage varies by department)

### Custom Infrastructure Already in Place

**Merch Wizard** — Creative workflow platform managing briefs, mockups, feedback, and approvals between clients and the design team. Actively used by the Creative department.

**Mission Control** — Financial reporting tool pulling touring data from ATVENU and e-commerce data from Shopify, organized by band. Built for leadership visibility.

**NetSuite ↔ Monday.com Integration** — Syncs financial and PO data with project tracking.

**ATVENU ↔ ShipHero Integration** — Syncs touring inventory with warehouse systems.

**Shipping Slip Automation** — AI-powered data entry into ShipHero, already running in production.

### Legacy Processes

**Royalty Calculator** — A Google Sheet that has been in use for over a decade. It calculates quarterly royalties for all bands by ingesting emailed sales reports from retail partners like Zumiez and Spencer's, plus Shopify exports. It works, but it's fragile, requires manual intervention multiple times per year, and takes **40+ hours per quarter** to maintain. It was never designed for the scale Manhead operates at today.

## The Foundation Problem

### AI Is Only As Good As the Data It Can Access

When leadership asks "How did Band X perform at the transaction level across their last tour?"—that should be a 30-second answer. Ask the system, get the report.

But here's the reality: that question requires pulling transaction-level data from ATVENU, which currently doesn't have a proper read/write API integration. The data exists, but it's not accessible in a way that AI—or any reporting tool—can reliably query.

This is the foundation problem. And it's not unique to ATVENU.

### What Happens Without It

Without solid data infrastructure:
- AI tools hallucinate answers because they can't access real data
- Integrations break under load or when systems update
- Teams lose trust in the technology after bad experiences
- You spend money on tools that can't deliver on their promises

### The Path Forward

Before Manhead can get value from AI copilots, automated insights, or intelligent recommendations, the underlying data infrastructure needs to be solid:

- Systems need reliable, bi-directional integrations
- Data needs to be structured and trustworthy
- Manual processes (like emailed sales reports) need automated ingestion

This isn't about delaying the good stuff. It's about making the good stuff actually work. The quick wins and foundation work happen in parallel—you get visible progress while building toward the bigger capabilities.

The good news: Manhead isn't starting from zero. Significant integration work has already been done. The path forward is about filling gaps, stabilizing fragile connections, and building the last mile that unlocks everything else.

## What's Already Built

### Before Building New, Maximize What Exists

One of the fastest paths to value is activating tools that have already been built but aren't being fully used.

**Mission Control** already exists. It consolidates touring data from ATVENU and e-commerce data from Shopify by band. It was built for leadership visibility. Before investing in new AI-powered forecasting tools, Mission Control could be re-launched with updated training and potentially enhanced with new capabilities.

**Merch Wizard** is actively used by the design team. It's a strong foundation that could be significantly enhanced with AI capabilities—automated mockup generation, AI-assisted briefs, tour history intelligence, and tools that let non-designers participate in ideation.

**Shipping Slip Automation** is already running in production. AI-powered data entry is working at Manhead today. This is proof of concept that practical AI can deliver value within Manhead's environment.

---

## What Happens Next

### If You Want to Move Forward

**Option A: Quick Wins + Foundation (Recommended)**
Start with the 60-90 day quick wins while building data infrastructure in parallel. This gives you visible progress and momentum while setting up for the bigger capabilities.

First projects would likely include:
- Merch Wizard AI mockup generation
- Mission Control relaunch with leadership training
- Royalty email parsing automation
- ATVENU data integration scoping

**Option B: Discovery First**
If there are departments or processes where we need more visibility before prescribing solutions (Operations, Retail, Licensing, Sales), we can start with targeted discovery engagements.

### How We Work

- **Project-based** — Each item is a discrete deliverable. No long-term commitments required.
- **Clear scope and outcomes** — You know what you're getting before we start.
- **Realistic timelines** — We tell you what's actually achievable, not what sounds good.

### Next Step

Let's schedule a call to discuss priorities and scope. From there, we can define the first project(s) and get started.
