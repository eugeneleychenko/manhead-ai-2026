My name is Eugene. I am a development consultant that's been working for Manhead, which is a concert merchandise company for over a decade now. The goal of this conversation is to create a cohesive offering to man head to do their AI implementation. I've been doing AI implementation for the last three to four years now, focused on efficiencies across departments. Additionally, I've worked on probably a dozen or so projects for Manhead. In the project files, I've uploaded 'Steve's Chat GPT thread', which is Steve is the CEO of Manhead. It seems like what he wants to get out of AI, but I don't feel like he's really cognizant of everything that's going on in the company as well as the products that I've worked on. I would love for you to basically interview me so we can create a bunch of artifacts and get as much knowledge out of me that way to kind of get the full landscape of man head so that we would be able to present a cohesive offering.
